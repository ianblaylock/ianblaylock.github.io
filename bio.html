    <p>I'm a hydrometeorologist for the National Weather Service. My primary job is to quality control hourly rainfall data to help provide accurate river forecasts. And I do! That said, it's not always raining, which frees up time to create award-winning data visualization software.</p>

    <p> I've made software for quickly viewing and editing hydrographs, rainfall mapping software for comparing mapped estimates with manual observations on the ground, flexible color-coded tabular displays of decoded weather observations, and scatterplots that help compare preliminary radar estimated rainfall. Tools to alert staff when river gages cross significant thresholds and when important text bulletins are received. Another widely used tool of mine helps manage XML configuration files across over a dozen workstations using a simple interface.</p>

    <p>Essentially, simplying the analysis of complex hydrometeorological phenomena by creating highly customizable software is my specialty. <span class="clickspan" onclick="selectMenuItemInDict(lvl1Dict,'softwareProjectsMenuItem')">Check out my projects page!</span></p>
